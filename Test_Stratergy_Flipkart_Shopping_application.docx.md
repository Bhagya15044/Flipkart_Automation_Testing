                                      **Test Strategy for Flipkart Shopping Application**

**Introduction**

This document outlines the test strategy for the Flipkart Shopping Website. Our aim is to ensure all core features—like browsing, cart, checkout, payments, and order tracking—work smoothly and reliably for every user.

We focus on delivering a fast, consistent, and error-free shopping experience across devices by combining manual and automated testing. This approach supports timely releases that meet both business goals and customer expectations.

**Objective :**

* Verify that all key features function reliably and as expected

* Deliver a seamless and easy-to-navigate user experience across all devices

* Validate performance, speed, and accuracy under real-world conditions

* Confirm strong security practices to protect user data

* Align the product quality with business goals and customer satisfaction

**Scope:** 

This testing initiative encompasses the thorough validation of all essential features that directly impact the end-user shopping experience on the Flipkart platform. The primary objective is to ensure the platform delivers secure, efficient, and reliable service to its customers**.**

**Features To Be Tested (In Scope) :**

**1\. User Authentication**

* Login, registration, password recovery.

**2\. Product Search and Filtering**

* Search, filters, sorting.

**3\. Product Detail Page**

* Product info, images, pricing, stock, reviews.

**4\. Shopping Cart**

* Add/remove items, update quantities, save cart.

**5\. Payment and Checkout**

* Payment methods, secure processing, order confirmation.

**6\. Order History and Tracking**

* View orders, track shipments, cancellations.

**7\. User Profile and Settings**

* Update info, manage addresses, communication preferences.

**8\. Wishlist**

* Add/remove favourites, move to cart.

**9\. Customer Support**

* FAQs, support requests.

**Features Not to Be Tested (Out of Scope) :**

* **Backend Administrative Tools and Dashboards:**  
  Usually handled by a separate team or different testing cycle, as these are not part of the shopping experience.

* **Vendor/Seller Management Modules:**  
  Internal or B2B features tested separately from the core user shopping flow.

* **Marketing and Promotional Campaigns (outside core shopping flow):**  
  Dynamic campaigns and promotions often require separate marketing and QA cycles.

* **Third-party Integrations Beyond Payment Gateways:**  
  Excluded unless they directly affect the user experience or core functionalities.

**Types of Testing:** 

To ensure a seamless, secure, and high-performing shopping experience, we conduct various types of testing focused on functionality, usability, and reliability.

* **Functional Testing**  
  Verifies that all features and user flows work as expected based on business requirements.

* **UI Testing**  
  Ensures that the interface is visually consistent and all elements like buttons, links, and forms function correctly.

* **API Testing**  
  Validates the backend services and data exchange between client and server using tools like Postman.

* **Performance Testing**  
  Checks how the application performs under expected and peak loads using tools such as JMeter or k6.

* **Security Testing**  
  Identifies potential vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access, insecure data transmission, and broken authentication.

* **Compatibility Testing**  
  Confirms that the application works seamlessly across multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and devices (desktop, mobile).

* **Usability Testing**  
  Evaluates how easy and intuitive the application is for end users to navigate and perform tasks.

* **Regression Testing**  
  Re-tests existing features to ensure that new updates or bug fixes have not introduced any issues.

**Tools Used**

* **Selenium** – Automates web UI testing to ensure consistent functionality

* **Postman** – Validates API responses and backend service behaviour

* **JIRA** – Manages defects, tasks, and team collaboration

* **Browser Stack** – Verifies compatibility across browsers and devices

**Team & Timeline**

**Team Setup:**

* 2 Manual Testers

* 1 Automation Tester (in training phase, contributing under guidance)

**Tentative Testing Timeline:**

* **Week 1:** Functional and UI Testing

* **Week 2:** API and Basic Performance Testing

* **Week 3:** Compatibility and Usability Testing

* **Week 4:** Regression Testing and Final Reporting

**Entry Criteria**

* Application build is deployed in QA/test environment

* Functional requirements are clearly defined and reviewed

* Test data and tools (e.g., Postman, Excel, Selenium) are ready for use

 **Exit Criteria**

* All major test cases are executed and passed

* No high or critical issues are left unresolved

* UAT (User Acceptance Testing) is completed and signed off

* Final test summary is reviewed and submitted

**Deliverables**

* Test Case Document (Excel-based)

* Test Execution Status Report

* Defect/Bug Report (via JIRA)

* Final Test Summary Report

**Risks & Mitigations**

* **Development delays:** May reduce available time for testing → Weekly check-ins with dev team

* **UI updates close to test cycles:** Could affect test case stability → Track and adapt quickly

* **Limited time for deep performance/security testing:** Focus on basic validations using available tools like JMeter/Postman

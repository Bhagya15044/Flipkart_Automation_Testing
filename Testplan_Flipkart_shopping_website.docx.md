**Objective:**

This test plan provides a comprehensive overview of the end-to-end automation testing process for the Flipkart shopping website. It outlines the scope, responsibilities, and activities the testing team will carry out to ensure all key functionalities work as intended.

**Scope:**

* Testing will encompass key functionalities of the Flipkart shopping website across major modules, including Authentication, Search and Filter, Product Detail Page, Cart, Payment, Checkout, Order History and Tracking, Profile and Settings, Wishlist, and Customer Support.  
* The testing approach will include a combination of Functional Testing, Regression Testing, Integration Testing, UI/UX Testing, Automated Testing, Performance Testing, Security Testing, and Compatibility Testing. These methods are chosen to ensure comprehensive coverage, system robustness, and a seamless shopping experience for end users across all platforms and environments.  
* Validation will be performed across diverse environments, including various web browsers, operating systems, and device types (mobile, tablet, and desktop), to ensure a consistent and seamless user experience.  
* Success criteria will be defined by the number and severity of defects identified, adherence to the testing schedule, and satisfaction ratings from end users and stakeholders.  
* Clearly defined roles and responsibilities will guide the testing process: the Test Lead will manage planning and coordination, Testers will execute test activities and report outcomes, and Developers will resolve any defects identified during testing.


**Inclusions:**

**Introduction:**

This section outlines the overall structure of the test plan, detailing its purpose, defined scope, and key objectives to ensure alignment with project and business goals.

**Test Objectives:** 

This section defines the primary objectives of the testing process. The goals are to identify and eliminate defects, validate key functionalities, ensure seamless user interactions, verify performance and compatibility, and confirm that all modules meet defined quality standards and business requirements.

The testing will cover the following major modules**:**

* **Authentication Module –** To verify secure login, registration, and session handling**.**

* **Search and Filter Module –** To ensure accurate search results and effective filtering functionality.

* **Product Detail Page Module –** To validate product information, images, pricing, and reviews.

* **Cart Module –** To confirm correct item addition, quantity updates, and price calculations.

* **Payment Module –** To test secure transactions, multiple payment methods, and error handling.

* **Checkout Module –** To verify address entry, order summary, and final order placement.

* **Order History and Tracking Module –** To ensure accurate display of order status and tracking updates.

* **Profile and Settings Module –** To test user profile management, password updates, and preferences.

* **Wishlist Module –** To validate product saving and Wish-list management**.**

* **Customer Support and Help Module –** To ensure access to FAQs, contact forms, and support channels.

**Test Environments:**

This section defines the environments in which testing will be performed to ensure the Flipkart shopping website functions seamlessly across a wide range of platforms and usage scenarios.

**1\. Operating Systems**

Testing will be conducted on major operating systems and their common versions to ensure OS-level compatibility:

* **Windows 10 & 11** (Desktop & Laptop)

* **macOS** 

* **Android**

* **iOS** 

**2\. Browsers:** 

Cross-browser testing is essential to validate rendering and functionality across different engines. The following browsers and versions will be included:

* **Google Chrome**

* **Mozilla Firefox** 

* **Microsoft Edge** 

**3\. Devices & Screen Sizes:**

To ensure responsive design and usability across device types, the application will be tested on:

* **Desktops** – 1920x1080 resolution (Windows/macOS)

* **Laptops** – 1366x768, 1440x900 resolutions

* **Tablets** – iPad, Android tablets (Portrait and Landscape modes)

* **Smartphones** – iPhone 13, Pixel 6, Samsung Galaxy A series (Various screen sizes and DPIs)

**4\. User Roles & Access Permissions**

Testing will account for different access levels and roles to validate permission-based functionalities:

* **Testers** – Full access to test environments with necessary credentials and admin/staging test data

* **Developers** – Access to dev and integration environments for debugging and deployment validation

* **Stakeholders / UAT Users** – Limited access to UAT or staging environments to validate final feature readiness

**Defect Reporting Procedure:** 

1. **Reporting Standards**:   
   All defects must be clearly documented using the designated defect tracking tool (e.g., Jira). Each report should include a meaningful title, environment details, reproduction steps, expected vs. actual results, severity, priority, and relevant attachments (screenshots, logs, or screen recordings).

2. **Defect Tracking Tools**  
   Defects will be logged and tracked in tools like Jira or Azure DevOps. These platforms will be used to assign issues, monitor progress, and maintain traceability throughout the testing cycle.

3. **Roles & Responsibilities**

   * Testers: Identify, document, and retest defects.

   * Developers: Analyse and resolve assigned defects.

   * Test Lead: Review defect quality, ensure timely resolution, and generate defect reports.

4. **Defect Lifecycle Flow**:   
   New **→** Assigned **→** In Progress **→** Fixed **→** Ready for Retest **→** Closed / Reopened

**Tools: JIRA** 

**Test Strategy:** 

This section outlines the overall approach to testing, including how we design, prioritize, and execute test cases to ensure quality delivery.

**Test Case Design Approach**

Test cases for all modules in scope will be designed using a combination of the following proven techniques**:**

* **Equivalence Partitioning –** to group similar inputs and reduce test cases**.**

* **Boundary Value Analysis –** to test edge values where issues are most likely.

* **Decision Table Testing –** to cover business rules and logic combinations**.**

* **State Transition Testing –** to test workflows and system state changes**.**

* **Use Case Testing –** to validate end-user interactions**.**


**Test Prioritization:** 

Test cases will be prioritized based on business impact and risk — critical flows like login, checkout, and payment will be tested first.

**Defect Reporting**

Defects will be logged in a defect tracking tool (Jira), and daily status updates including new issues will be shared with the development team via email.

Types of Testing to be Performed

* **Smoke Testing** – to ensure the system is stable before deeper testing**.**

* **Sanity Testing** – quick checks after minor changes.

* **Regression Testing** – to confirm new changes didn’t break existing features.

* **Retesting –** to verify that reported bugs are fixed.

* **Usability, Functional & UI Testing** – to ensure a smooth, accurate, and user-friendly experience.

**Test Cycles**

Multiple rounds of testing will be conducted until the product meets quality standards**.**

**Entry & Exit Criteria**

These criteria define when each testing phase can start (Entry) and when it’s considered complete (Exit).

**Requirement Analysis Phase**

* **Entry Criteria:**

  * Requirements documents are shared with the QA team.

    

* **Exit Criteria:**

  * All requirements are reviewed and fully understood.

  * Any open questions or ambiguities are clarified**.**

 **Test Execution:** 

**Entry Criteria:**

* Approved Test Scenarios and Test Cases signed off by the client

* Stable application build is deployed and ready for testing


**Exit Criteria:**

* All test cases executed, and results documented

* Defect reports submitted and communicated to stakeholder

**Test Closure:**

**Entry Criteria:**

* Completion of all planned test execution

* Availability of test case execution reports and defect logs

**Exit Criteria:**

* Test Summary Report finalized and shared with stakeholders

* Lessons learned documented and test artifacts archived

 **Tools:**

The following tool will be utilized for this project:

* JIRA – For defect tracking, test cycle monitoring, and task management**.**

 **Risks and Mitigations**

| Risk |  | Mitigation Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Non-availability of key resources |  | Maintain a backup resource pool and ensure knowledge transfer across the team |

 **Approvals:** 

The QA team will submit the following documents for client review and approval at each stage:

* Test Plan

* Test Scenarios

* Test Cases
